----------------------------------------------
ENPH 479 Project - 3D Rigid Body Physics Engine, OpenGL Rendering with Compute Shaders
----------------------------------------------
- Rendering Engine code is located in directory "renderer"

- To build the Rendering Engine code, the following libraries are required:
	-OpenGL
	-GLEW
	-GLFW3
	-Boost
	-GLM

- On OS X, the following linker flags are required:
	-lGLEW, -lboost_system, -lboost_filesystem, -lboost_iostreams

- Once Rendering Engine is built and compiled, the executable and the folders "data" "shaders" and "objects" needs to be copied to the "controller" folder.

- Physics Engine code is located in "phys_engine"
- Run zzmainzz.m in "controller" to run physics simulation
